Version: 1.75
Date: 2020-06-14
Authors@R: c(person("Ananda", "Mahto", email = "ananda@mahto.info",
             role = c("aut", "cre")),
             person("Jota", role = "aut"),
             person("Ed", "Morton", role = "aut"))
Description: Nothing special. A very incohesive collection of functions, that's
    all. If a function disappears, I might have moved it to another package.
