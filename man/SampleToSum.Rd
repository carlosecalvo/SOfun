\title{Sample from a Specific Range with a Target Vector Sum}
\usage{
SampleToSum(
  Target = 100,
  VecLen = 10,
  InRange = 1:100,
  Tolerance = 2,
  showSum = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Target}{The value that the vector should \code{sum} to}

\item{VecLen}{The required vector length}

\item{InRange}{The input range that values can be sampled from}

\item{Tolerance}{A "buffer" for the \code{Target} argument, allowing the
resulting sum to be slightly higher or slightly lower than specified.}

\item{showSum}{Logical. Should the resulting total be shown?}
}
\value{
A vector
}
\description{
Takes a sample from a given range (for example, 1 to 100), and a specified
resulting vector length (for example, 10), which add up to a specified
value.
}
\note{
There is a good chance that with certain settings, this will be VERY
SLOW!

\examples{

set.seed(1)
SampleToSum()

SampleToSum()

SampleToSum(Tolerance = 0)

SampleToSum(Tolerance = 0)

set.seed(123)
## You'll have to wait a few seconds here
SampleToSum(Target = 1163, VecLen = 15, InRange = 50:150)
