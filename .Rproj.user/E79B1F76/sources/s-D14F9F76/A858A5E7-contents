# SOfun

Functions I've written as answers to R questions on Stack Overflow. Destined to be the most important R package you have ever loaded in your R session. 

## Installation

```
source("http://news.mrdwab.com/install_github.R")
install_github("mrdwab/SOfun")
```

## Contents

The "SOfun" package is filled with a very strongly cohesive set of functions. 

Visit the [Reference page](http://mrdwab.github.io/SOfun/reference/index.html) for an overview of the functions in this package.

Don't ask me why I did this.
